Issues with zero band gap
-------------------------

Recap from earlier Key idea: construct a functional such that the
*variational* orbital energies

.. math:: \varepsilon^\mathsf{Koopmans}_i = \langle \varphi_i | H | \varphi_i \rangle = \partial E_\mathsf{Koopmans}/\partial f_i


possess two key properties:

-  they are independent of the corresponding occupancies :math:`f_i`

-  they are equal to the corresponding total energy difference
   :math:`E_i(N-1) - E(N)`
