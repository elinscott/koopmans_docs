The w90 block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This block contains keywords specific to ``wannier90.x``, which are documented `here <https://github.com/wannier-developers/wannier90/raw/v3.1.0/doc/compiled_docs/user_guide.pdf>`_. Because the occupied and empty manifolds are wannierised separately, you may want to use slightly different wannierisation protocols for each. You can do this by placing keywords within the ``occ`` and ``emp`` sub-dictionaries e.g.

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/tutorial_2/si.json
  :lines: 84-103

In this case both the occupied and empty manifolds will use ``sp3`` projections, but only the empty manifold will use the provided ``dis_froz_max`` etc.
